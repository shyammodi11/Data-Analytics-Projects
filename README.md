# Data-Analytics-Projects
Compilation of machine learning projects written in R and Python programming languages respectively

# [Project 1: Iris Dataset Analysis Using PCA](https://github.com/shyammodi11/Data-Analytics-Projects/blob/main/PCA%20code%20(Iris%20dataset).R)
* Took a set of data called “Iris” which already exists in RStudio. Iris data consists of 150 observations and 4 features. 
* Used libraries like biplot, screenplot, ggfortify etc. 
* Then used the function prcomp(), I proceeded to execute the PCA. 
* After its execution, I found the PCA object using the function summary().
* Plotted the components of PCA to give a much better visual representation to look at the data.

# [Project 2: Sales Prediction And Analysis Using Time Series Analysis](https://github.com/shyammodi11/Data-Analytics-Projects/blob/main/Sales%20prediction%20using%20ARIMA.ipynb)
* This project presents uni-and multi-variate analysis techniques applied to plug research forecasting. 
* First the dataset was loaded in the jupyter notebook followed by basic indexing and visualization.  
* Then presented the essential statistical analysis, starting with univariate ARIMA models. 
* Then proceeded with the forecasting and validation part of the algorithm. This includes training and testing.
* Finally, plotted the final output on a 2D graph for better visual representation and future prediction.

# [Project 3: Share Prices Prediction Using Linear Regression](https://github.com/shyammodi11/Data-Analytics-Projects/blob/main/Share%20prices%20prediction%20(Linear%20Regression).ipynb)
* Implemented linear regression to the shares of a company listed on the stock market.
* Loaded the dataset in the jupyter notebook, conducted indexing and created new variables for store necessary data.
* Created a new dataframe and treated the null values to reduce noise in the dataset.
* Started the implementation of linear regression i.e. training and testing.
* Plotted the known and forecasted points on a 2D graph of that companies stock prices.
