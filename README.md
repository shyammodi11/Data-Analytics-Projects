# [Project 1: Iris dataset analysis Using PCA](https://github.com/shyammodi11/Data-Analytics-Projects/blob/main/PCA%20code%20(Iris%20dataset).R)
* Took a set of data called “Iris” which already exists in RStudio. Iris data consists of 150 observations and 4 features. 
* Used libraries like biplot, screenplot, ggfortify etc. 
* Used the function prcomp(), I proceeded to execute the PCA. 
* After its execution, I found the PCA object using the function summary().
* Plotted the components of PCA to give a much better visual representation to look at the data.
